This is a driver for weewx that captures data from software-defined radio 
using the rtldavis software.


===============================================================================
Hardware

Tested with the Realtek RTL2838UHIDIR.  Should work with any software-defined
radio that is compatible with the rtl-sdr software. 

Output from Davis Vantage Pro and Davis Vantage Vue stations is supported. 
The driver supports currently the US and EU hop-frequencies.

===============================================================================
Installation

1) install pre-requisites

1.a) install weewx
    http://weewx.com/docs.html

1.b) install golang
    eg: on raspberry pi:
    sudo apt-get install golang
    look at rtldavis repository readme to see
    how to do the full install of the golang
    sudo apt-get install golang git cmake librtlsdr-dev
    Get librtlsdr
    Create a new file as root named /etc/udev/rules.d/20.rtlsdr.rules
    
2) download the driver

wget -O weewx-rtldavis-master.zip https://github.com/lheijst/weewx-rtldavis/archive/master.zip

3) install the driver

sudo wee_extension --install weewx-rtldavis-master.zip

4) configure the weewx driver

sudo wee_config --reconfigure --driver=user.rtldavis --no-prompt

5) compile the GO sources when needed (see below)

6) Test the rtldavis executably stand alone (see below)

7) run the driver directly to identify the packets you want to capture

cd /home/weewx
sudo PYTHONPATH=bin python bin/user/rtldavis.py --cmd="/home/pi/work/bin/rtldavis"

8) modify the [Rtldavis] section of weewx.conf using a text editor

- check the DEFAULT_SENSOR_MAP in rtldavis.py for the extra 'freqError0' to
  'freqError4' data you want to store in the data base (or not).
- also check routine new_archive_record(self, event) in rtldavis.py for the 
  extra 'pct_good_1' to 'pct_good_4' data you want to store in the data base
- possibly modify the 'cmd' parameter

9) start weewx

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

===============================================================================
5. How to compile the GO sources  see depository rtldavis readme

5.a) create a profile for the standard user
    make sure there is a /home/pi/work directory
    change the path of /home/pi/work when needed
	sudo nano ~/.profile
	export GOROOT=/usr/lib/go
	export GOPATH=/home/pi/work
	export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
	source ~/.profile
5.b) compile the GO src files when needed (i.e. when changed)
    First time cd /home/pi
               go install -v github.com/lheijst/rtldavis
               That should create the /home/pi/work directory
               You might just want to create it yourself before 
               this step.
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lheijst/rtldavis
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	go install -v .
	The executable is: /home/pi/work/bin/rtldavis

===============================================================================
6. Test the rtldavis executably stand-alone with:
    /home/pi/work/rtldavis -tf US -tr 1
    see below for explanation - check to make sure $GOPATH is correct should be /home/pi/work/
	$GOPATH/bin/rtldavis
	options:
	-tr [transceivers]
		[transceivers] is a combination-code of 1 to more Davis Vantage stations,
		where: receiver 1=1, 2=2, 3=4, 4=8, 5=16, 6=32, 7=64, 8=128
		Example: With three transceivers RSS:1, Wind:2 and Leaf-Soil:3 the value of 
		transceivers wiil be 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 
	-tf [transmitter-frequencies]
		valis options are: EU or US; EU is default.
	-ex [extra loop_period in ms]
		When more than one sensors are read, the number of time-outs sometimes can
		reduces with a longer loop_period. A value of 200 is OK.
		Note: when the value of ex is too big, also time-outs will occur, so
		try the ex settinf in small steps (of 50 ms).
	The following options of the original rtldavis package are not in use anymore:
	-v [extra verbose logging to stderr]
		This option is removed
	-id [transceiver]
		This option is overruled by the -tr option.
	Example: $GOPATH/bin/rtldavis -tf US -tr 3

	The options below are used to search an unknown frequency band for hop
	frequencies. For Austalia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) these frequencies are not 
	known yet (2019-03-16). They can be scanned with the following commands:
	AU: $GOPATH/bin/rtldavis -startfreq 918000000 -endfreq 926000000 -stepfreq 20000
	NZ: $GOPATH/bin/rtldavis -startfreq 921000000 -endfreq 928000000 -stepfreq 20000
	WARNING: with a stepfreq size of 20kHz the scanning will take about 48 hours!

===============================================================================
7. How to run the driver directly

Run the driver directly for testing and diagnostics.  For example, if weewx
was installed using setup.py:

cd /home/weewx
sudo PYTHONPATH=bin python bin/user/rtldavis.py --help

If weewx was installed from deb or rpm:

sudo PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx python /usr/share/weewx/user/rtldavis.py --help


===============================================================================
Configuration

Use the [Rtldavis] section of the weewx configuration file (nominally weewx.conf) to
adjust the driver configuration.

The default configuration uses this command:

"/home/pi/work/bin/rtldavis"
Note: the -tf and -tr options are added automatic to the command with the options below.

[Rtldavis]
    # This section is for the rtldavis sdr-rtl USB receiver.
    cmd = /home/pi/work/bin/rtldavis -ex 200

    # Radio frequency to use between USB transceiver and console: US or EU
    # US uses 915 MHz, EU uses 868.3 MHz.  Default is EU.
    transceiver_frequency = EU
    
    # Used channels: 0=not present, 1-8)
    # The channel of the Vantage Vue ISS or Vantage Pro or Pro2 ISS
    iss_channel = 1
    # The values below only apply for Vantage Pro or Pro2
    anemometer_channel = 0
    leaf_soil_channel = 0
    temp_hum_1_channel = 0
    temp_hum_2_channel = 0
    # rain bucket type (0: 0.01 inch, 1: 0.2 mm)
    rain_bucket_type = 1
    
    # Print debug messages
    #  0=no logging; 1=minimum logging; 2=normal logging; 3=detailed logging
    debug_parse = 0    # 0
    debug_rain = 0     # 0
	debug_rtld = 0     # rtldavis logging: 1=inf; 2=(1)+data+chan; 3=(2)+pkt

    log_unknown_sensors = True
    log_unmapped_sensors = True

By default the logging options are False.
    
    # The driver to use:
    driver = user.rtldavis

===============================================================================
How to diagnose problems

First try running the rtldavis application to be sure that it works properly:

$GOPATH/bin/rtldavis

Be sure that you are capturing data from the sensors you care about.  To do
this, you might want to experiment with some of the options to rtldavis.  

Once that is working, run the driver directly to be sure that it is collecting
data from the rtldavis application.

cd /home/weewx
sudo PYTHONPATH=bin python bin/user/rtldavis.py

In the weewx configuration file, enter the Rtldavis options (if necessary).
Then run weewx directly in one shell while you monitor the weewx log in a 
separate shell:

in shell 1:
cd /home/weewx
sudo ./bin/weewxd weewx.conf

in shell 2:
tail -f /var/log/syslog

At this point, you should see data from your sensors in the weewx
LOOP and REC output.  If not, check the log file.  Use the logging options in
the [Rtldavis] section of the weewx configuration file to help figure out which
sensors are captured, recognized, and parsed.

Once you are satisfied with the output when running weewx directly, run weewx
as a daemon and configure rc script or systemd to run weewx at system startup.

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
